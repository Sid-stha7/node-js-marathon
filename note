models object inside process there is export so we use export in process 

object destruction : we use it inorder to exract property of other function , code simple hunxa

# node built in models 
* http createserver(): the function is used to create server , takes fucntion as argument and the function inside takes 
  two arguments (req, response ) request and response 
  const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{

  })

  # Npm packages 
* nodemon : It is used in order to minimize the hassel of server restarting 
    when everytime we make changes

* express : instead of building server from sctrach we gonna use express which has many methods like get , post, etc etc 

    get fucntion takes two arguments url and (req,res)

    # Core Node JS

    # event loop 

    # asynchronous programming 

  readfile method takes two arguments which is file name and data of the file 
  here we will be executing two functions and each fucntions has different runtime one takes longer another takes shorter 
   what node js basically does is that it executes both fucntions but the return value of the second function is printed at first because
  the first function is still running while another fucntion had beed already executed when the first is done the event is sent to stack and again and returned the value

  # synchronous programming 
  we are using synchronous function so the below fucntion only executes when the fist function is completed

# fucntional programming 

why to use this new bird ? because we can divide any task to specific functions which makes code easy to understand 
and cleaner


# Event emmiter :
 It is one of the core module of node which is used to create a custom events and react to those events when emitted accordingly .
